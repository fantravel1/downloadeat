                <h2 class="content-section-title">The Phone Number Problem</h2>
                <p>Most food delivery apps require a phone number for two purposes: account registration (SMS verification) and driver communication. For travelers, this creates a dilemma. Your home phone number may not receive SMS abroad (or may be expensive to use), and many local apps require a number from their country specifically.</p>
                <p>This guide breaks down exactly which countries require local phone numbers, which accept international numbers, and the best workarounds for each situation.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="no-local-needed">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">No Local Number Needed</h2>
                <p>In these countries, you can use your international phone number on all major delivery apps without issues.</p>

                <h3>United States, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand</h3>
                <p>English-speaking countries have the most tourist-friendly delivery ecosystems. Uber Eats, DoorDash, Deliveroo (UK), and Menulog (Australia) all accept international phone numbers. Your existing Uber account works seamlessly. No local SIM needed for delivery apps.</p>

                <h3>Western Europe (France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, <a href="/countries/portugal.html">Portugal</a>)</h3>
                <p>Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Glovo, Wolt, and Just Eat all accept international phone numbers across Western Europe. EU roaming rules mean European travelers can use their home numbers freely across EU countries. Non-EU travelers may want an eSIM for data, but the phone number itself is not a barrier.</p>

                <h3>Eastern Europe (<a href="/countries/croatia.html">Croatia</a>, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary)</h3>
                <p>Wolt, Glovo, Bolt Food, and Uber Eats accept international numbers. Driver communication via app chat means phone calls are rare. No local SIM required for delivery.</p>

                <h3>UAE &amp; Qatar</h3>
                <p>Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, and Uber Eats all work with international numbers. The UAE is very tourist-oriented and delivery infrastructure accommodates foreign visitors.</p>

                        <h4>Uber Eats Is the Universal Workaround</h4>
                        <p>In virtually every country where Uber Eats operates, it accepts international phone numbers. Even in countries where local apps require local numbers, Uber Eats usually works with your home number. It is the single most important app to have installed before you travel.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

            <section class="content-section" id="recommended">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Local Number Strongly Recommended</h2>
                <p>In these countries, international numbers technically work on some apps, but having a local number significantly improves your experience.</p>

                <h3>Japan</h3>
                <p>Uber Eats works with international numbers. However, all other Japanese delivery apps (Demae-can, menu, Wolt Japan) work better with a Japanese number. Drivers in Japan rarely call, so the phone number is mainly for registration. A Japanese eSIM with data is sufficient for Uber Eats, but for local apps, a number-enabled SIM is helpful. See our <a href="/countries/japan.html">Japan guide</a>.</p>

                <h3>South Korea</h3>
                <p>Uber Eats Seoul works with international numbers but has limited coverage. The dominant app Baemin requires a Korean phone number for registration. Coupang Eats also strongly prefers Korean numbers. If you want to use Korean delivery apps, a local SIM is nearly essential. Available at airports (Incheon has SIM card vending machines) and convenience stores.</p>

                <h3>India</h3>
                <p>Swiggy and Zomato technically accept international numbers, but OTP (one-time password) delivery to foreign numbers is unreliable. Many travelers report that verification codes simply never arrive to their international number. An Indian prepaid SIM solves this &mdash; available at airports with passport and visa. Jio and Airtel are the best options.</p>

                <h3>Turkey</h3>
                <p>Yemeksepeti (the dominant Turkish app) and Getir prefer Turkish phone numbers. Uber Eats operates in Istanbul with international numbers. If you are staying in Turkey for more than a few days, a Turkish SIM from Turkcell or Vodafone Turkey (available at airports) makes the delivery experience much smoother.</p>

                <h3>Thailand</h3>
                <p>Grab works with international numbers, but Line Man (Thailand's popular delivery app) strongly prefers Thai numbers since it is tied to the LINE messaging app, which most locals use with a Thai number. Tourist SIMs from AIS, dtac, or TrueMove are cheap and available at every airport.</p>

                        <h4>Airport SIM Cards Are Your Best Friend</h4>
                        <p>Most international airports in Asia have SIM card counters right in the arrivals hall. Prices are reasonable (usually $5&ndash;15 for a tourist plan with data and a local number). Staff will help you set up the SIM. This 5-minute investment opens up every local delivery app in the country.</p>

                <h2 class="content-section-title">Local Number Required</h2>
                <p>In these countries, delivery apps cannot practically be used without a local phone number.</p>

                <h3>China</h3>
                <p>Both Meituan and Ele.me require a Chinese phone number. There is no workaround &mdash; you cannot register or receive driver communications without one. On top of this, you also need WeChat Pay or Alipay (which require a Chinese bank account). China is the hardest market in the world for tourist food delivery. A Chinese SIM is available at airports, but the payment barrier remains regardless.</p>

                <h3>Vietnam (local apps)</h3>
                <p>Grab works with international numbers in Vietnam, but local apps like ShopeeFood and Baedalmin (Vietnamese delivery) require Vietnamese phone numbers. Given how cheap local SIMs are (Viettel or Mobifone at any airport for $3&ndash;5), getting one is recommended regardless of delivery needs.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="esim">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">eSIM Alternatives</h2>
                <p>eSIMs have become a popular alternative to physical SIM cards for travelers. Here is what you need to know about using eSIMs for delivery apps.</p>

                <h3>Data-Only eSIMs (Airalo, Nomad, etc.)</h3>
                <p>Most travel eSIMs provide <strong>data only</strong> &mdash; no phone number. This means you get internet access but cannot receive SMS verification codes or phone calls from drivers. Data-only eSIMs work fine for apps that accept your existing international number (like Uber Eats), since communication happens through the app, not SMS.</p>

                <h3>eSIMs with Phone Numbers</h3>
                <p>Some eSIM providers offer local phone numbers. Holafly provides eSIMs with local numbers in select countries. aloSIM and others are expanding this capability. If you need a local number for delivery app registration, specifically look for eSIMs that include a phone number, not just data.</p>

                <h3>Dual SIM Strategy</h3>
                <p>Most modern smartphones support dual SIM (one physical + one eSIM, or two eSIMs). The optimal travel strategy: keep your home SIM active for receiving messages and calls, and add a local eSIM for data and local number. This gives you the best of both worlds for delivery apps.</p>

                    <div class="tip-box-icon">

                        <h4>Set Up Your eSIM Before Landing</h4>
                        <p>Airport WiFi is often slow and unreliable. Set up and activate your eSIM before you board your flight, so data is available the moment you land. Many eSIMs can be purchased and installed in advance and activated upon arrival in the destination country.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="voip">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">VoIP &amp; Alternative Workarounds</h2>

                <h3>Google Voice</h3>
                <p>Google Voice provides a US phone number that can receive SMS. This may work for apps that accept US numbers. However, many delivery apps now detect and block VoIP numbers.</p>

                <h3>WhatsApp</h3>
                <p>In some countries (Brazil, Colombia, parts of Africa), drivers communicate via WhatsApp. As long as your WhatsApp is active (on any number), you can receive messages. This is a secondary communication channel, not a registration method.</p>

                <h3>Hotel Phone</h3>
                <p>Some travelers use their hotel's phone for receiving verification calls (not SMS). This is unreliable and not recommended as a primary strategy. Most delivery apps require SMS verification, which hotel phones cannot receive.</p>

                            <p>Data-only eSIMs work for apps that accept your international number (like Uber Eats). For apps that require a local number, you need an eSIM that includes a phone number, not just data. Check eSIM providers like Holafly for number-enabled options, or get a physical SIM at the airport.</p>

                            <p>China absolutely requires it (Meituan, Ele.me). South Korea's Baemin requires a Korean number. India's apps have unreliable OTP delivery to international numbers. Turkey's Yemeksepeti prefers Turkish numbers. Japan's local apps (not Uber Eats) strongly prefer Japanese numbers. In all these countries, Uber Eats works with international numbers as a fallback.</p>
