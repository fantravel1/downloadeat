                <h2 class="content-section-title">Why Delivery Etiquette Matters</h2>
                <p>Ordering food delivery in your home country is second nature. You know whether to meet the driver at the door, whether to tip, and what to do if there is a gate code. But abroad, these norms can be completely different &mdash; and getting them wrong can lead to canceled orders, confused drivers, or cultural awkwardness.</p>
                <p>This guide covers the delivery etiquette norms you need to know in every major region of the world. From the moment you place the order to the moment you receive it, understanding local customs will make your experience smoother and more respectful.</p>

            <!-- ========== ASIA ========== -->
            <section class="content-section" id="asia">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Asia</h2>

                <h3>Japan</h3>
                <p>Japanese delivery culture is characterized by extreme politeness and efficiency. Drivers almost never call you &mdash; they rely entirely on GPS and the address in the app. Contactless delivery (<em>okihai</em>) has become the norm since the pandemic. The driver places your food at the door, takes a photo, and leaves. No tipping. No small talk. Just clean, quiet efficiency.</p>
                <p>If you do meet the driver face to face, a slight bow and a "<em>arigatou gozaimasu</em>" (thank you very much) is appreciated. In apartment buildings, drivers typically come to your door. In hotels, they come to the lobby. Never tip &mdash; it is not part of Japanese culture and can cause confusion. See our <a href="/countries/japan.html">Japan guide</a> for more.</p>

                <h3>South Korea</h3>
                <p>Korea has one of the most developed delivery cultures in the world. Drivers deliver to your actual door, even in high-rise apartments &mdash; they will take the elevator up. Speed is expected and delivery times are remarkably fast, often under 30 minutes. Tipping is not customary. Drivers may call when they arrive, and a brief phone interaction is normal. The challenge for tourists is that most drivers speak only Korean.</p>

                <h3>Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines)</h3>
                <p>Motorbike delivery is the dominant mode across Southeast Asia. Drivers navigate through dense traffic on scooters, and delivery times can vary wildly depending on traffic. In Thailand, <a href="/coming-soon.html">Grab</a> and <a href="/coming-soon.html">Foodpanda</a> drivers often call when they arrive. Meeting at the lobby or building entrance is standard &mdash; drivers rarely come up to apartments.</p>
                <p>In Vietnam, drivers will call you (often multiple times) if they cannot find you. Having your phone's ringer on is important. In the Philippines, meeting at the gate of your compound or building entrance is normal. Across the region, small cash tips are appreciated but not expected. A warm smile goes a long way.</p>

                        <h4>The Motorbike Factor</h4>
                        <p>In Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, nearly all deliveries arrive by motorbike. This means your food may be slightly jostled during transit. Soups and liquid-heavy dishes are riskier orders. Many experienced travelers in SE Asia stick to solid foods for delivery and save the soup for dine-in.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>China</h3>
                <p>China's delivery culture is incredibly fast &mdash; 20&ndash;30 minute delivery is standard, and drivers (called <em>kuaidi xiaoge</em>) are under enormous time pressure. They will call you repeatedly if they cannot find you. Meeting at the building entrance or gate is normal. Security guards in Chinese apartment complexes usually know the drill and will direct drivers. No tipping. The entire experience is in Chinese, and drivers will not speak English. See our <a href="/coming-soon.html">China guide</a> for workarounds.</p>

                <h3>India</h3>
                <p>Indian delivery culture is warm and accommodating. Drivers will typically call when they are close and when they arrive. Meeting at the door or gate is standard. In apartment buildings, drivers usually come to your door. In gated communities, you may need to meet at the gate. Tipping is increasingly common on apps like Swiggy and Zomato &mdash; a small tip of 20&ndash;50 rupees (about $0.25&ndash;$0.60) is appreciated. Cash on delivery is very popular and widely available.</p>

            <!-- ========== EUROPE ========== -->
            <section class="content-section" id="europe">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Europe</h2>

                <h3>Building Access: The Great Challenge</h3>
                <p>The biggest delivery challenge in Europe is building access. Unlike the US where most drivers come straight to your door, European apartment buildings often have locked entrances that require access codes, buzzers, or intercoms.</p>

                <h3>France</h3>
                <p>Parisian apartment buildings use <em>digicodes</em> &mdash; numeric keypads at the entrance. If you do not put the digicode in your delivery notes, the driver will be stranded outside. Always include the code and your floor number. Drivers typically will not come above the ground floor unless you explicitly meet them or your building has a working elevator and accessible hallways. French drivers communicate via the app and may ring the intercom.</p>

                <h3>Scandinavia (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland)</h3>
                <p>Scandinavian buildings use <em>portkods</em> (door codes). Include this in your delivery notes. Swedish and Nordic delivery is very professional &mdash; drivers are punctual and efficient. Tipping is not expected but rounding up is appreciated. Contactless delivery is very common. Wolt is the dominant app in Finland, and its interface makes building access instructions easy to add.</p>

                <h3>UK &amp; Ireland</h3>
                <p>British delivery culture is among the most straightforward. Drivers come to your door. In apartment buildings, they buzz your flat and either you come down or they come up, depending on building policy. Tipping is appreciated but not mandatory &mdash; rounding up by a pound or two is standard. Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat all have smooth processes.</p>

                <h3>Southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece, <a href="/countries/portugal.html">Portugal</a>)</h3>
                <p>Mediterranean delivery tends to be more relaxed. Drivers may call when they arrive and expect you to come downstairs. In older buildings without elevators (very common in city centers), meeting on the ground floor is the norm. Glovo is a dominant app across Southern Europe and its chat function handles most communication. Tipping is not expected but appreciated in Spain and Italy.</p>

                <div class="tip-box tip-box--warning">
                    <div class="tip-box-icon">

                        <h4>Always Include Building Access Information</h4>
                        <p>The number one cause of failed deliveries in European cities is building access. Always include the door code, buzzer number, floor number, and any specific instructions (like "turn left after the courtyard"). Many European buildings have inner courtyards with multiple staircases &mdash; be specific.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Eastern Europe (<a href="/countries/croatia.html">Croatia</a>, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary)</h3>
                <p>Delivery culture is growing rapidly across Eastern Europe. Wolt, Glovo, and Bolt Food are the major players. Drivers generally come to the entrance of your building and may call. Tipping is not strongly expected but is becoming more common. Communication is usually via app chat. English proficiency among drivers varies &mdash; in tourist areas, basic English is usually fine.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- ========== AMERICAS ========== -->
            <section class="content-section" id="americas">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">The Americas</h2>

                <h3>United States &amp; Canada</h3>
                <p>North American delivery culture is defined by tipping and door-to-door service. Drivers come directly to your door (or apartment entrance), and tipping is strongly expected &mdash; 15&ndash;20% in the US, 10&ndash;15% in Canada. Not tipping is considered rude and can affect your ability to get future deliveries, as some drivers may avoid low-tip orders. In apartment complexes, include the gate code and unit number. Contactless delivery ("leave at door") is now the most popular option.</p>

                <h3>Mexico</h3>
                <p>Mexican delivery is growing rapidly via <a href="/coming-soon.html">Uber Eats</a>, <a href="/coming-soon.html">Rappi</a>, and <a href="/coming-soon.html">DiDi Food</a>. In many Mexican neighborhoods, gated communities (<em>fraccionamientos</em>) require meeting the driver at the gate or having security let them in. Tipping 10&ndash;15% is appreciated. Drivers may call when they arrive. Cash on delivery is available and popular, especially for tourists who may have trouble with local card payments.</p>

                <h3>Latin America (Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Chile)</h3>
                <p>Across Latin America, security is a factor in delivery etiquette. Many residential areas have gated entrances, security guards, or porteros (doormen). The driver drops off with the guard or at the gate, and you collect from there. In Brazil, iFood drivers typically call and wait at the building entrance. In Colombia, Rappi drivers are known for their pink bags and will often call via the app when nearby. Tipping is becoming more common but is not mandatory &mdash; small tips are appreciated.</p>

                        <p>If you are staying in a building with a portero or security guard, let them know you are expecting a delivery. Many guards will hold the food for you and call your room. Some buildings have dedicated delivery reception areas. This is a security feature, not an inconvenience &mdash; work with it, not against it.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="middle-east">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Middle East</h2>

                <h3>UAE (Dubai, Abu Dhabi)</h3>
                <p>The UAE has a highly developed delivery culture. Apps like Talabat, Deliveroo, and Careem dominate. Drivers are professional, deliveries are fast, and the experience is very smooth. In apartment towers (which is most of Dubai), drivers typically come to the lobby and you meet them there &mdash; security often does not allow drivers to go upstairs. In villas, drivers deliver to the gate. Tipping is not mandatory but rounding up by 5&ndash;10 AED is common.</p>

                <h3>Ramadan Considerations</h3>
                <p>During Ramadan (dates vary each year), many Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. While delivery apps still operate and non-Muslims can order freely, be respectful &mdash; avoid eating conspicuously in public areas. Some restaurants may have reduced menus or hours during the day. After sunset (<em>iftar</em> time), delivery demand surges and wait times can be significantly longer. Plan ahead.</p>

                <h3>Saudi Arabia</h3>
                <p>Delivery is extremely popular in Saudi Arabia. <a href="/coming-soon.html">Hungerstation</a> and <a href="/coming-soon.html">Jahez</a> are local favorites alongside Uber Eats. Drivers deliver to the gate of compounds and building entrances. During prayer times (five times daily), some restaurants may temporarily stop taking orders, and drivers may pause for prayer. Patience during these brief windows is expected and respectful.</p>

                <h3>South Africa</h3>
                <p>Mr D Food, Uber Eats, and Bolt Food are the main apps. Security is a significant factor in South African delivery. Most residential areas are gated, and drivers deliver to the gate rather than to your door. In apartment complexes, meeting at the security checkpoint is standard. Tipping is customary &mdash; 10% or 10&ndash;20 ZAR in cash is the norm.</p>

                <h3>Nigeria</h3>
                <p>Delivery apps like Chowdeck, Glovo, and Jumia Food are growing in Lagos, Abuja, and other cities. Gated estates are the norm in Nigeria, and drivers deliver to the gate. Communication via phone call is standard &mdash; drivers will call multiple times if needed. Cash on delivery is dominant. Traffic in Lagos can make delivery times extremely unpredictable. Patience is essential.</p>

                <h3>Egypt &amp; Morocco</h3>
                <p>In Cairo, Talabat and Elmenus are popular. Drivers deliver to the building entrance and often call when they arrive. Cash on delivery is the most common payment method. In Morocco, Glovo operates in major cities. Delivery to riads (traditional houses with interior courtyards) can be tricky &mdash; many riads are in narrow medina alleys where motorbikes cannot enter. Meeting the driver at the nearest accessible point is often necessary. Include clear landmark-based directions.</p>

                        <p>In many African and Middle Eastern cities, GPS addresses may not be perfectly accurate. Use landmarks in your delivery notes: "next to the blue mosque," "opposite the Shell station," "red gate on the left after the roundabout." This is how local navigation works and drivers will understand landmarks much better than GPS coordinates.</p>

                    <li><strong>Include detailed delivery notes</strong> &mdash; building codes, floor numbers, landmarks, and any access instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep your phone on</strong> &mdash; drivers in many countries will call when they arrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drop a GPS pin</strong> &mdash; especially in countries where addresses are imprecise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn "thank you"</strong> in the local language &mdash; a small gesture that is universally appreciated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient with traffic</strong> &mdash; delivery times vary enormously by city and time of day.</li>

                    <li><strong>Don't ignore driver calls</strong> &mdash; a missed call can result in a canceled delivery in many countries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't order without an accessible delivery location</strong> &mdash; narrow alleys, gated areas without codes, and unmarked buildings cause failed deliveries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't eat conspicuously in public during Ramadan</strong> in Muslim countries &mdash; order to your room and be discreet.</li>

                <p>One of the most confusing aspects of delivery abroad is how drivers communicate. Here is a general breakdown:</p>
                <ul style="margin: var(--space-md) 0; padding-left: var(--space-xl); line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Phone call culture:</strong> India, China, Vietnam, Philippines, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey &mdash; drivers call, often multiple times, and expect you to answer.</li>
                    <li><strong>App message/chat culture:</strong> Europe, US (contactless), Japan (rare contact), South Korea, Australia, Singapore.</li>
                    <li><strong>WhatsApp culture:</strong> Brazil, Colombia, parts of Africa &mdash; drivers may message via WhatsApp.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal contact:</strong> Japan, South Korea (contactless), Scandinavia &mdash; drivers use GPS and app, rarely contact you.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>If a driver calls and you do not speak the language, answer and say your location slowly in simple English. Many drivers understand basic English words like "lobby," "gate," "door." If communication fails, use the app's chat with Google Translate. Having your accommodation's name in the local script ready on your phone can also help enormously.</p>

                            <p>It varies by country and building type. In the US, UK, and Australia, drivers come to your door. In most of Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, you typically meet at the lobby, building entrance, or gate. In Japan and South Korea, contactless delivery at the door is increasingly common. Always check local norms and add clear instructions in the delivery notes.</p>

                            <p>Yes, in many European cities (Paris digicodes, Stockholm portkods, etc.) you absolutely need to include the building access code in your delivery notes. In gated communities in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, security guards usually handle access. In the US and Australia, apartment gate codes should be included. Forgetting the code is the number one cause of failed deliveries in European cities.</p>

                            <p>In phone-call cultures (India, China, Vietnam, Turkey, Nigeria), drivers expect phone communication and will call you. In app-message cultures (Europe, US, Japan, South Korea), in-app chat is standard. As a tourist, texting through the app is almost always better than calling, since you can use translation tools and avoid spoken language barriers. Answer calls if the driver initiates, but for your messages, stick to the app's chat.</p>
