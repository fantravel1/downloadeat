                <h2 class="content-section-title">The Late-Night Hunger Problem</h2>
                <p>Jet lag is the enemy of regular meal schedules. You land in a new city, crash at your hotel, and wake up at 2 AM starving. Or you are out late exploring and want food delivered to your room. Late-night delivery availability varies enormously by city and country &mdash; what feels like a 24-hour convenience in Bangkok becomes a 10 PM hard stop in many European cities.</p>
                <p>This guide covers which apps deliver late, which cities never sleep, and the clever workarounds for getting food after traditional restaurant hours.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="24-hour-cities">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">The 24-Hour Cities</h2>
                <p>These cities have robust late-night and sometimes round-the-clock delivery options.</p>

                <h3>Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
                <p>Bangkok may be the single best city in the world for late-night delivery. The city's famous street food culture means many vendors and restaurants operate well past midnight. Grab and Foodpanda both have extensive late-night options. 7-Eleven delivery via Grab is available extremely late. You can get pad thai, grilled skewers, and convenience store snacks delivered at 3 AM without issue.</p>

                <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
                <p>Tokyo's Uber Eats operates until around 1&ndash;2 AM in busy districts like Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Roppongi. Many izakayas and ramen shops stay open late. Convenience store delivery (7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Lawson) via Uber Eats extends availability further. Tokyo is not truly 24-hour for delivery but is very strong until 2 AM. See our <a href="/countries/japan.html">Japan guide</a>.</p>

                <h3>Seoul, South Korea</h3>
                <p>Korea's legendary delivery culture operates very late. Baemin and Coupang Eats have options available past midnight, especially for fried chicken and Korean BBQ. Convenience stores (CU, GS25) deliver via apps. Seoul's nightlife culture means late-night food is deeply ingrained in the city.</p>

                <h3>New York City, USA</h3>
                <p>"The city that never sleeps" lives up to its name for delivery. Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub all have options available 24/7 in Manhattan. Late-night pizza, halal carts, and diner food are available at any hour. Other US cities (LA, Chicago, Miami) are decent until 1&ndash;2 AM but not truly 24-hour.</p>

                <h3>Dubai, UAE</h3>
                <p>Dubai's delivery scene operates very late, especially on weekends (Thursday/Friday nights). Talabat and Deliveroo have options until 2&ndash;4 AM. Many restaurants in Dubai stay open extremely late, and the city's expat culture supports round-the-clock dining. Desert heat means people eat late anyway.</p>

                        <p>Even when restaurants close, convenience store delivery often continues. 7-Eleven items via Grab (Thailand), FamilyMart via Uber Eats (Japan), and CU via Baemin (Korea) provide snacks, drinks, instant noodles, and basic meals well past midnight.</p>

                <h2 class="content-section-title">European Closing Times</h2>
                <p>Most European cities have earlier closing times for delivery compared to Asia or the Americas.</p>

                <h3>General Pattern</h3>
                <p><strong>Weekdays:</strong> Most delivery apps stop accepting orders between 10 PM and midnight. In smaller cities, it can be as early as 9:30 PM.</p>
                <p><strong>Weekends:</strong> Extended to midnight&ndash;1 AM in major cities. Some restaurants on Uber Eats and Deliveroo push to 2 AM on Friday/Saturday nights in London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Madrid.</p>

                <h3>Best European Cities for Late-Night Delivery</h3>
                <ul style="margin: var(--space-md) 0; padding-left: var(--space-xl); line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>London:</strong> Deliveroo and Uber Eats until 1&ndash;2 AM weekends, midnight weekdays. Kebab shops stay open latest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Berlin:</strong> Good until midnight. D&ouml;ner kebab joints are the late-night heroes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Madrid:</strong> Spain eats late by default. Glovo and Uber Eats available until 1 AM or later. Dinner at 10 PM is normal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amsterdam:</strong> Uber Eats and Thuisbezorgd until midnight. FEBO (vending machine snack chain) offers late options.</li>
                    <li><strong>Istanbul:</strong> Turkey's food culture runs late. Getir and Yemeksepeti available until 1&ndash;2 AM in central areas.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Early-Closing Cities</h3>
                <p>Scandinavian cities (Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki), Swiss cities, and many German cities outside Berlin tend to stop delivery earlier, sometimes by 10 PM. Plan dinner delivery before 9 PM in these locations to be safe.</p>

                <h2 class="content-section-title">Quick Commerce: The Late-Night Savior</h2>
                <p>Quick commerce (q-commerce) apps specialize in delivering convenience store-type items in 10&ndash;30 minutes. They often operate later than traditional restaurant delivery apps.</p>

                <h3>Major Quick Commerce Apps</h3>
                <ul style="margin: var(--space-md) 0; padding-left: var(--space-xl); line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Gopuff</strong> (US, UK) &mdash; Snacks, drinks, ice cream, alcohol, toiletries. Open until 3&ndash;4 AM in many US cities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Getir</strong> (Turkey, UK, parts of Europe) &mdash; Groceries and essentials in minutes. Late-night availability varies by city.</li>

                        <p>Many quick commerce apps carry surprisingly complete selections: instant noodles, frozen meals, fresh sandwiches, ice cream, drinks (including alcohol where legal), toiletries, and even phone chargers. At 2 AM, a quick commerce order can be more satisfying than the limited late-night restaurant options.</p>

                        <p>Use contactless delivery where possible. Meet the driver in the hotel lobby rather than at the street entrance. Keep your phone charged for delivery tracking. Avoid going outside your accommodation to meet drivers in unfamiliar areas late at night. If ordering with cash, have the exact amount ready so you do not flash large bills.</p>

                            <p>True 24-hour delivery is available in a handful of cities: New York (Uber Eats, DoorDash), parts of Bangkok (Grab), Dubai (some nights), and select areas of Seoul and Tokyo. In most other cities, there is a gap between roughly 3&ndash;6 AM where options are extremely limited or nonexistent.</p>

                            <p>Yes. 7-Eleven via Grab (Thailand) and Uber Eats (Japan), FamilyMart via Uber Eats (Japan, Taiwan), CU and GS25 via Baemin (Korea), and quick commerce apps (Gopuff, Getir, Blinkit, GrabMart) all deliver convenience store-type items late at night. This is often the best late-night option when restaurants have closed.</p>
