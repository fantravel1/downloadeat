                <h2 class="content-section-title">Why Cash on Delivery Matters for Travelers</h2>
                <p>When your foreign credit card gets declined, when Apple Pay is not available in the country, when the local app requires a bank account you do not have &mdash; cash is your safety net. Cash on delivery (COD) lets you order food through an app and pay the driver in local currency when the food arrives.</p>
                <p>For tourists in countries with challenging digital payment ecosystems, COD is often the most reliable way to get food delivered. This guide covers where COD is dominant, where it is available as a backup, and where it does not exist. For the full picture on payments, see our <a href="/topics/tourist-payment-guide.html">Tourist Payment Guide</a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="heavy-cash">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Heavy Cash Markets</h2>
                <p>In these countries, cash on delivery is the dominant or most popular payment method. Many customers prefer cash even when digital options exist.</p>

                <h3>India</h3>
                <p>India is the world's largest cash-on-delivery market for food. Swiggy and Zomato both prominently offer COD, and a huge percentage of orders are paid in cash. For tourists, this is a blessing: even if your foreign card does not work and UPI is inaccessible, you can always pay cash. Keep denominations of 100 and 500 INR notes handy. Drivers always carry some change but prefer close-to-exact amounts.</p>

                <h3>Egypt</h3>
                <p>Cash is king in Egypt. Talabat, Elmenus, and Uber Eats all offer cash on delivery in Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities. Most Egyptians pay for delivery with cash. Having Egyptian pounds ready is essential for food delivery. ATMs are available at airports and in city centers.</p>

                <h3>Morocco</h3>
                <p>Glovo Morocco operates with heavy cash usage. In Marrakech, Casablanca, and Rabat, cash on delivery is the standard. Keep Moroccan dirhams in small denominations. Delivery to riads in the medina may require meeting the driver at a nearby accessible point.</p>

                <h3>Nigeria</h3>
                <p>Cash delivery is dominant in Lagos, Abuja, and other Nigerian cities. Chowdeck, Glovo, and Jumia Food all offer COD. Nigerian naira in moderate denominations is essential. Drivers may not carry change for very large bills.</p>

                <h3>Turkey</h3>
                <p>Yemeksepeti and Getir both support cash payment. While digital payments are growing in Turkey, cash remains very popular for delivery. Turkish lira notes in common denominations work well. Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir all have strong COD delivery options.</p>

                <h3>Vietnam</h3>
                <p>Grab Vietnam, ShopeeFood, and local apps heavily support cash. Vietnamese dong is used in sometimes large nominal amounts (a meal might be 100,000&ndash;200,000 VND), so keep appropriate bills. Cash delivery is very smooth and widely used across Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.</p>

                <h3>Indonesia</h3>
                <p>Grab and GoFood (Gojek) both offer cash payment in <a href="/countries/indonesia.html">Indonesia</a>. Cash is deeply embedded in Indonesian delivery culture, especially outside Jakarta. Indonesian rupiah in 10,000&ndash;50,000 denominations are ideal.</p>

                        <h4>ATM Tip: Break Large Bills First</h4>
                        <p>ATMs often dispense large-denomination bills. Before ordering COD delivery, break large bills at a convenience store, hotel front desk, or by making a small purchase. This avoids the awkward situation of paying for a $5 meal with a $50 bill.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="mixed-markets">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Mixed Markets (Cash Available, Cards Preferred)</h2>
                <p>These countries offer cash on delivery as an option, but digital payments are increasingly common.</p>

                <h3>Thailand</h3>
                <p>Grab and Foodpanda in Thailand support cash delivery. Thai baht in 20, 50, and 100 denominations work well. Bangkok and Chiang Mai have the most delivery options. While card payments are growing, cash remains widely accepted and reliable.</p>

                <h3>Mexico</h3>
                <p>Uber Eats, Rappi, and DiDi Food all offer cash payment in Mexico. Mexican pesos in 50 and 100 denominations are ideal. Cash delivery is particularly useful for tourists whose foreign cards may be declined on Rappi or DiDi.</p>

                <h3>Colombia</h3>
                <p>Rappi Colombia supports cash on delivery. Colombian pesos in moderate denominations work well. Cash is especially common for delivery in neighborhoods outside the central business districts of Bogota, Medellin, and Cartagena.</p>

                <h3>Philippines</h3>
                <p>GrabFood and Foodpanda Philippines both offer cash. Philippine pesos in 100 and 500 denominations are useful. Cash delivery is very common outside Metro Manila.</p>

                <h3>Saudi Arabia</h3>
                <p>Hungerstation, Jahez, and Uber Eats in Saudi Arabia support cash payment. Saudi riyals are accepted. Cash is commonly used alongside digital payment in the Kingdom.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="mostly-cashless">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Mostly Cashless Markets</h2>
                <p>In these countries, cash on delivery is rare or unavailable. Plan to use digital payment methods.</p>

                <h3>Sweden</h3>
                <p>Sweden is one of the most cashless societies in the world. Many businesses do not accept cash at all. Delivery apps (Uber Eats, Wolt, Foodora) are card-only. Having a working digital payment method is essential.</p>

                <h3>UK</h3>
                <p>While Just Eat occasionally offers cash in the UK, Deliveroo and Uber Eats are card-only. The UK has moved heavily toward cashless payment. Have a card or mobile wallet ready.</p>

                <h3>Singapore</h3>
                <p>Singapore's delivery ecosystem is predominantly cashless. Grab occasionally offers cash but it is not standard. Card or GrabPay is the norm.</p>

                <h3>South Korea</h3>
                <p>Korean delivery is almost entirely digital. Baemin and Coupang Eats prefer Korean card or e-wallet payment. Cash delivery is very uncommon.</p>

                <h3>China</h3>
                <p>China is paradoxically both highly digital and cash-unfriendly for delivery. Meituan and Ele.me do not support cash on delivery. WeChat Pay or Alipay is required. Cash cannot bail you out here.</p>

                        <p>In Sweden, Singapore, and South Korea, having a backup digital payment method is essential. Cash is not a reliable fallback for delivery apps in these markets. Ensure you have at least one working card or mobile wallet before you need to order food.</p>

Keep small bills ready, meet the driver in a safe location (hotel lobby, building entrance), and avoid showing large amounts of cash. Cash on delivery is used by millions of people daily in cash-heavy markets without issues.</p>

                            <p>Having exact or close-to-exact change is strongly recommended. Motorbike delivery drivers in Asia and Latin America often carry limited change. Break large bills beforehand. If your order is the equivalent of $8, paying with a $10 bill is fine. Paying with a $50 bill may cause the driver to not have enough change.</p>

                            <p>Grab, Swiggy, Zomato, Rappi, Talabat, Glovo (select markets), Uber Eats (select markets), Foodpanda, GoFood/Gojek, and many local apps accept cash. DoorDash, Deliveroo, and Wolt generally do not offer cash payment. Always check the payment options in the app for your specific location.</p>
