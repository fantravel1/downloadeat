                <h2 class="content-section-title">The Payment Problem for Travelers</h2>
                <p>You find the right delivery app, browse the menu, and build the perfect order. Then you hit the payment screen and discover your foreign credit card is not accepted. Or the app requires a local phone number for OTP verification. Or the only payment option is an e-wallet tied to a domestic bank account you do not have.</p>
                <p>Payment is the single biggest barrier tourists face when using food delivery apps abroad. This guide breaks down every major payment method, which apps support them, and which countries are easiest (and hardest) for tourist payment. For app-specific scores, see our <a href="/topics/payability-score.html">Payability Score</a> system.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="foreign-cards">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Foreign Credit &amp; Debit Cards</h2>
                <p>Foreign Visa and Mastercard credit cards are the most universally useful payment method for tourists on delivery apps. Here is the reality across major apps:</p>

                <h3>Visa &amp; Mastercard</h3>
                <p><strong>Best acceptance:</strong> Uber Eats (nearly all markets), Deliveroo (UK, EU, UAE, HK), Wolt (Europe, Japan), Glovo (Europe, Africa). These apps accept international Visa and Mastercard with minimal friction.</p>
                <p><strong>Mixed acceptance:</strong> Grab (SE Asia &mdash; international cards accepted but occasional declines), Rappi (Latin America &mdash; foreign cards work but may trigger fraud blocks), Foodpanda (varies heavily by market).</p>
                <p><strong>Poor acceptance:</strong> Meituan/Ele.me (China &mdash; no foreign cards), Baemin (Korea &mdash; Korean cards preferred), iFood (Brazil &mdash; foreign cards frequently declined).</p>

                <h3>American Express</h3>
                <p>Amex has much more limited acceptance on delivery apps. Uber Eats accepts Amex in most markets. Deliveroo accepts Amex in the UK. Most other apps do not accept Amex or have spotty support. If Amex is your only card, Uber Eats is your safest bet.</p>

                        <p>Many banks flag international transactions as fraud. Before traveling, notify your bank of your travel dates and destinations. Enable international transaction notifications. Some cards (especially from smaller banks) may still be declined on foreign apps even with notification &mdash; carry a backup card from a different issuer.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="mobile-wallets">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Apple Pay &amp; Google Pay</h2>
                <p>Mobile wallets are the tourist's best friend on delivery apps. No need to type in card numbers, no 3D Secure pop-ups that might fail internationally, and instant payment. Here is where they work:</p>

                <h3>Apple Pay Availability</h3>
                <p>Apple Pay is supported on Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Wolt in markets where Apple Pay itself is available. This covers the US, UK, most of Europe, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, Canada, and more. However, Apple Pay is not available in every country &mdash; it is limited in parts of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.</p>

                <h3>Google Pay Availability</h3>
                <p>Google Pay has broader country availability than Apple Pay but less consistent support on delivery apps. Uber Eats supports Google Pay in many markets. Grab supports Google Pay in select SE Asian markets. Coverage is expanding but not universal.</p>

                        <h4>Set Up Mobile Wallets Before You Travel</h4>
                        <p>Add your cards to Apple Pay or Google Pay before departure. Some banks restrict adding cards while abroad or require additional verification. Having your mobile wallet ready before you land means instant, frictionless payment from the moment you arrive.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="local-wallets">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Local E-Wallets &amp; Payment Systems</h2>
                <p>Many countries have dominant local payment systems that are deeply integrated into delivery apps. Most of these are inaccessible to tourists, but some offer workarounds.</p>

                <h3>WeChat Pay &amp; Alipay (China)</h3>
                <p>China's delivery apps (Meituan, Ele.me) require WeChat Pay or Alipay. Both traditionally require a Chinese bank account. Alipay has introduced a "Tour Pass" feature that allows international Visa/Mastercard to be loaded into a limited Alipay wallet &mdash; this may work for some food delivery, but support is inconsistent. WeChat Pay has a similar international card linking feature with similar limitations.</p>

                <h3>GrabPay (Southeast Asia)</h3>
                <p>Grab's e-wallet, GrabPay, can be topped up with a foreign credit card in some markets. This gives you a local payment method without a local bank account. Check whether GrabPay top-up with your card is available in your destination country.</p>

                <h3>GCash (Philippines)</h3>
                <p>GCash is the Philippines' leading e-wallet. It requires a Philippine phone number to set up. Tourists can get a local SIM and register for a basic GCash account, which can then be used on delivery apps like GrabFood. Top up at convenience stores (7-Eleven, Ministop) with cash.</p>

                <h3>PIX (Brazil)</h3>
                <p>PIX is Brazil's instant payment system and is the preferred method on iFood. It requires a Brazilian bank account or fintech account (like Nubank). Tourists cannot use PIX without a CPF (tax ID) and local account. Cash on delivery is your fallback in Brazil.</p>

                <h3>UPI (India)</h3>
                <p>UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is India's dominant payment rail, used on Swiggy and Zomato. It requires an Indian bank account. Foreign tourists cannot use UPI directly. Use your foreign credit card (may have issues) or cash on delivery instead.</p>

                <h3>M-Pesa (Kenya, Tanzania, East Africa)</h3>
                <p>M-Pesa is the dominant mobile money system in East Africa. It requires a local SIM card and registration. Some delivery apps in Kenya accept M-Pesa. Tourists can register with a local SIM, but the process may require ID verification.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="cash-on-delivery">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Cash on Delivery</h2>
                <p>Cash is the universal fallback. In many countries, cash on delivery (COD) is not just a backup &mdash; it is the dominant payment method. See our dedicated <a href="/topics/cash-on-delivery.html">Cash on Delivery guide</a> for the full breakdown.</p>
                <p><strong>Heavy cash markets:</strong> India, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines.</p>
                <p><strong>Cash available but card preferred:</strong> Thailand, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p><strong>Mostly cashless:</strong> Sweden, Singapore, South Korea, UK, Australia.</p>

                        <h4>Keep Small Bills for Cash Delivery</h4>
                        <p>Delivery drivers often do not carry change for large bills. If your order is $8 equivalent, do not pay with a $50 note. Keep small denominations handy. In many countries, the ATM gives you large bills &mdash; break them at a convenience store or hotel before ordering.</p>

                <h2 class="content-section-title">Prepaid &amp; Travel Cards</h2>
                <p>Travel-oriented prepaid cards and fintech cards can be excellent for delivery apps abroad.</p>
                <h3>Wise (TransferWise)</h3>
                <p>Wise's multi-currency card works on most delivery apps that accept Mastercard. You can hold local currencies and avoid conversion fees. Particularly useful in Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>
                <h3>Revolut</h3>
                <p>Revolut cards work well on delivery apps globally. The app lets you freeze/unfreeze the card instantly, which is useful for security. Virtual card numbers add an extra layer of protection.</p>
                <h3>Charles Schwab Debit / No-Fee ATM Cards</h3>
                <p>For cash-on-delivery markets, a no-fee ATM card (like Charles Schwab) lets you withdraw local currency at any ATM without fees. Combined with cash delivery, this is a reliable payment strategy for countries like India, Egypt, and Vietnam.</p>

In these countries, Uber Eats is typically the only option for tourists with foreign cards. In most other countries, a foreign Visa/Mastercard will work on at least one major delivery app.</p>
