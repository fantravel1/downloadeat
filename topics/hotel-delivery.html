                <h2 class="content-section-title">Why Hotel Delivery Is Different</h2>
                <p>Ordering food delivery to a hotel is not quite the same as ordering to your home. There is an extra layer of logistics: security, lobby access, front desk communication, and sometimes hotel policies that restrict outside food. But with the right approach, getting food delivered to virtually any hotel in the world is straightforward.</p>
                <p>This guide covers everything you need to know &mdash; from international hotel chain policies to specialty accommodations like capsule hotels in <a href="/countries/japan.html">Japan</a>, riads in Morocco, and hostels across Europe.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="lobby-vs-room">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Lobby vs. Room Delivery</h2>
                <p>In virtually every country, delivery drivers bring food to the <strong>hotel lobby</strong>, not to your room. This is the universal standard. Security policies in most hotels prevent unknown visitors from going to guest floors. Here is what happens in practice:</p>
                <ul style="margin: var(--space-md) 0; padding-left: var(--space-xl); line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>The driver arrives at the hotel entrance and contacts you (via the app or phone call).</li>
                    <li>You come down to the lobby to collect the food, or the front desk holds it for you.</li>
                    <li>Some hotels will call your room to notify you.</li>
                    <li>In rare cases (small guesthouses, boutique hotels), drivers may be allowed upstairs.</li>
                </ul>

                        <h4>The Pro Move</h4>
                        <p>Before your first delivery order, let the front desk know you are expecting food delivery. Many hotel staff will happily hold your delivery and call your room when it arrives. This saves you from having to watch the app and rush downstairs.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="chain-hotels">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Major Hotel Chain Policies</h2>
                <p>International hotel chains are generally very accommodating of food delivery. Here is what to expect at the major brands:</p>

                <h3>Marriott (including W, Westin, Sheraton, Courtyard)</h3>
                <p>Marriott properties worldwide are well-accustomed to food delivery. Drivers deliver to the lobby, and front desk staff will either notify you or hold the food. Some Marriott properties in the US and Asia have designated pickup areas for delivery orders. No restrictions on outside food in your room.</p>

                <h3>Hilton (including DoubleTree, Hampton, Conrad)</h3>
                <p>Hilton properties work smoothly with delivery apps. Similar to Marriott &mdash; lobby pickup is standard. Hilton's Digital Key feature means you may not even interact with the front desk normally, but for delivery, a quick heads-up to reception is still helpful.</p>

                <h3>Hyatt (including Park Hyatt, Andaz, Hyatt Regency)</h3>
                <p>Hyatt properties are delivery-friendly across all tiers. Higher-end Hyatt properties (Park Hyatt, Andaz) may have more formal lobbies where front desk staff handle the exchange discreetly. Budget Hyatt brands (Hyatt Place, Hyatt House) are very casual about delivery.</p>

                <h3>IHG (Holiday Inn, InterContinental, Crowne Plaza)</h3>
                <p>IHG hotels are widely used by travelers who order delivery regularly. Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express properties are particularly casual and delivery-friendly. In Asia, IHG properties are very common and well-versed in handling Grab, Foodpanda, and Uber Eats deliveries.</p>

                <h3>Accor (Sofitel, Novotel, ibis, Pullman)</h3>
                <p>Accor's budget brand ibis is perhaps the most delivery-friendly hotel chain in the world, given its traveler demographic. Novotel and Pullman properties are equally accommodating. Sofitel, being luxury-tier, may have more formal lobby procedures but will still handle deliveries.</p>

                        <h4>All-Inclusive Resorts May Restrict Delivery</h4>
                        <p>All-inclusive resorts (common in Mexico, Caribbean, Maldives, Turkey) often prohibit outside food delivery. Since meals are included in your rate, the resort has little incentive to accommodate delivery drivers. Check with your specific resort before ordering.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

            <section class="content-section" id="accommodation-types">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">Delivery by Accommodation Type</h2>

                <h3>Airbnb / Vacation Rentals</h3>
                <p>Airbnbs are often the easiest accommodation type for food delivery. You have a specific address, direct door access, and no hotel lobby to navigate. Use the exact address from your Airbnb booking. If it is an apartment building, include the buzzer code, floor, and apartment number. The only challenge: if the Airbnb is in a rural area or building with poor GPS accuracy, drop a pin manually.</p>

                <h3>Hostels</h3>
                <p>Hostels in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America are generally delivery-friendly. The common area or reception desk is your pickup point. Since hostels are budget-oriented, the staff understand that guests prefer delivery over expensive nearby restaurants. Some hostels have communal kitchens where you can eat your delivery comfortably.</p>

                <h3>Capsule Hotels (Japan)</h3>
                <p>Capsule hotels present a unique challenge. You have no personal space to receive delivery &mdash; your "room" is a sleeping pod. You must meet the driver at the building entrance and eat in the common area. Many capsule hotels have strict rules about food in the sleeping areas. Some have lounge spaces where eating is permitted. Check with reception before ordering. See our <a href="/countries/japan.html">Japan guide</a> for more.</p>

                <h3>Riads (Morocco)</h3>
                <p>Riads are traditional Moroccan houses converted to guesthouses, often located in narrow medina alleys. Delivery drivers on motorbikes cannot always reach the door. You may need to meet the driver at the nearest accessible point. Give the riad's name (known locally) and a landmark. Ask the riad staff for the best meeting point for delivery &mdash; they will know.</p>

                <h3>Guesthouses &amp; B&amp;Bs</h3>
                <p>Small guesthouses and bed-and-breakfasts vary widely. Some have no issue with delivery; others may find it unusual. A quick ask to the host goes a long way. In Southeast Asia, guesthouse staff are very accustomed to delivery and will often help facilitate it.</p>

                <h3>Resorts</h3>
                <p>Beach resorts and isolated resort properties may be difficult for delivery. Remote locations, gated entrances with security, and long driveways mean drivers may not be able to reach you easily. For resorts with on-site restaurants, delivery is usually unnecessary. For resorts in urban or semi-urban areas (common in Bali or Thailand), delivery to the front gate is usually possible.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="delivery-notes">
                <h2 class="content-section-title">What to Write in Delivery Notes</h2>
                <p>Clear delivery notes are the difference between a smooth hotel delivery and a canceled order. Here is a template that works worldwide:</p>
                <div style="background: var(--gray-50); border-radius: var(--radius-md); padding: var(--space-lg); margin: var(--space-lg) 0; font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 0.9rem; line-height: 1.7;">

                        <h4>Use the Hotel's Full Name</h4>
                        <p>Many delivery drivers use Google Maps to navigate. If you just put the street address, the driver may end up at the wrong entrance of a large hotel complex. The hotel's full name (e.g., "Hilton Garden Inn Midtown East") ensures the GPS goes to the right building.</p>

                <h2 class="content-section-title">Country-Specific Hotel Delivery Tips</h2>

                <h3>Japan</h3>
                <p>Most Japanese hotels (APA, Toyoko Inn, Dormy Inn, international chains) work well with Uber Eats. Drivers come to the lobby. Front desk staff are accustomed to it. Capsule hotels and ryokans are the exceptions &mdash; check first. See our <a href="/countries/japan.html">Japan guide</a>.</p>

                <h3>Thailand</h3>
                <p>Thai hotels are very delivery-friendly. <a href="/coming-soon.html">Grab</a> and Foodpanda deliver to hotel lobbies without issue. Resort islands like Koh Samui and Phuket have good delivery coverage in touristy areas.</p>

                <h3>United States</h3>
                <p>US hotels are extremely accustomed to delivery. Some even have dedicated delivery pickup areas. In Las Vegas, hotel casino complexes can be confusing &mdash; use the hotel tower name and entrance, not just "Bellagio" (which is enormous).</p>

                <h3>Europe</h3>
                <p>European hotels in city centers work well with delivery. The main challenge is older buildings with complex entrances. Use the hotel name, not just the address. In <a href="/countries/portugal.html">Portugal</a> and <a href="/countries/croatia.html">Croatia</a>, Uber Eats, Glovo, and Wolt all deliver to hotels routinely.</p>

                <h3>Southeast Asia</h3>
                <p>Hotels across <a href="/countries/indonesia.html">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/countries/taiwan.html">Taiwan</a>, Thailand, and the Philippines are very accustomed to food delivery. Security guards at hotel entrances know the drill and will direct drivers to the lobby.</p>

                            <p>Yes, in most countries and most hotels. Major international chains (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, IHG, Accor) all accommodate food delivery to the lobby. Drivers cannot go to your room, but they will drop food at the front desk or lobby. Some all-inclusive resorts and traditional accommodations may restrict outside food delivery.</p>

                            <p>The vast majority of modern hotels are accustomed to app-based food delivery. Front desk staff in most countries deal with delivery drivers regularly. The driver drops off your food in the lobby, and you collect it. Some luxury properties and all-inclusive resorts are exceptions. If you are unsure, ask the front desk before ordering.</p>

                            <p>Airbnbs are often easier for delivery than hotels because you have a specific address and direct access. Use the exact Airbnb address, and include any building codes, buzzer numbers, or floor information in the delivery notes. The only challenge is Airbnbs in areas with poor GPS accuracy or complex building access.</p>

                            <p>Include: the full hotel name, the specific entrance (if there are multiple), "Hotel lobby pickup" or "Leave with front desk," your name and room number, and your phone number. The hotel's full name is crucial because GPS may take the driver to the wrong entrance of a large hotel complex.</p>
